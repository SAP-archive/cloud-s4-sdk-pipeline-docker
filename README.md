# Dockerfiles for the SAP S/4HANA Cloud SDK Pipeline
 
## Description

This collection of Dockerfiles build the foundation for the Docker images used by the [Pipeline for the SAP S/4HANA Cloud SDK](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline).
It contains two type of Dockerfiles. 
The folder `s4sdk-jenkins-master` contains a Dockerfile for a Jenkins server, which is preconfigured to run the pipeline.
The other folders contain Dockerfiles for Docker images which are used in the pipeline to run steps, such as deployments to the SAP Cloud Platform. 

## Requirements

In order to run and build the Docker images you have to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Download and Installation

To build a Docker image, such as `s4sdk-jenkins-master`, go to this folder and execute the following command:
```shell
 $ docker build -t s4sdk/jenkins-master-image .
```
 
Afterwards the image is available and a new container can be spawned with following command:
```shell
 $ docker run -p 8080:8080 --name my-jenkins s4sdk/jenkins-master-image
```

The same applies for all other Dockerfiles.

The SAP S/4HANA Cloud SDK already provides a script called `cx-server` to avoid these manual steps. It can be found in the same named folder on the root of each SAP S/4HANA Cloud SDK project archetype. Together with the `server.cfg` file, this is all you need for starting your instance of the SAP S/4HANA Cloud SDK Cx Server.  
For instantiating the SAP S/4HANA Cloud SDK Cx Server, you need to provide a suitable host with a linux operating system and Docker installed. Please also ensure that the user with whom you start the Cx Server belongs to the [docker group](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/).

To create a new project using the SDK execute the following command:
 
 ```shell
  $ mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.sap.cloud.s4hana.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=scp-cf-tomee -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.0
 ```
 
 In the new project there is a folder called `cx-server`.
 This folder needs to be copied to the future host on which the Cx Server is intended to run.
 
 On the host machine execute the following command in the folder `cx-server`.
 This will start the Jenkins server.
 ```shell
  $ ./cx-server start
 ```
